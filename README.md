This is one of a few python exercises I did as a Purwadhika Data Science and Machine Learning course student. In this exercise, I practiced web scrapping using the **BeautifulSoup** package.
This particular [hobby shop website](https://www.scifijapan.com/merchandise/bandai-ultraman-ultra-500-figure-list) provides information about Bandai's products. 

In this particular exercise, we want to get all the names of **Ultraman and Monsters** figurines that are listed on the website.

The end goal of this exercise is to create a **JSON File** that consists of the names of each figurine using **Python**.

You can see the full code I made in the **UltramanScrapping** file.
